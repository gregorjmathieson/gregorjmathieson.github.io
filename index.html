            <div id="subtitle">About Me</div>
            <div id="textbox"> I am currently a 4th year Electronics and Electrical Engineering student at the University of Edinburgh. My interests include Digital System Design and Analysis, Computer Engineering, HDL programming, Web Development, and Language Learning. The programming languages that I know the best are C, Python, Verilog HDL, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Haskell.<br><br>In my spare time I really enjoy hillwalking, cycling, and reading. Some of my favourite authors are Haruki Murakami, Yukio Mishima, and Anton Chekhov.</div>

            <div id="subtitle">Language Progress</div>
            <div id="textbox">
                One of my favourite hobbies is to study foreign languages. I have taken lessons in the past, as well as ample self-study in as many languages as I can. The four languages that I have made the most progress in are Spanish, French, Mandarin Chinese, and Japanese. Click on the flags below to see my progress in each respective language!

            <div id="textbox">Through my degree, I have worked on many electronics projects. Most recently, I have been helping Dr Thomas Morstyn and his research team develop a GUI for their open-source power-network simulation tool OPEN. Click here to see my development log.<br><br>Previously I have worked on projects including FPGA design, as shown in the video below, as well as analogue circuit design. I will add more in-depth coverage of my projects as well as some videos and images in the future.</div>
