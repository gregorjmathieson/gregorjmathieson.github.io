            <div id="textbox"> For me, French is a beautiful and intriguing language that sits at the forefront of a cultural history rich in art, literature, and philosophy. To learn and understand the French language is to open yourself to a world of ideas that could not be experienced the same way through a translation or adaptation. </div>

                <div id="textbox">I would like to be able to spend some time in France and get comfortable speaking at a normal conversation level. I am not particularly interested in getting any official recognition of my French fluency level, however I would like to eventually be able to read simple novels in French.</div>
