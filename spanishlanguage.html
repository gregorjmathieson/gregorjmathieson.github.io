            <div id="textbox"> Growing up in Texas, I had a lot of exposure to the Spanish language. I studied it most of the way through my schooling and I have continued to study the language into my adulthood. After traveling to Spain recently and gaining exposure to Castillian Spanish for the first time, I now believe that I have expanded my horizons and seen how beautiful this truly global language can be. </div>
